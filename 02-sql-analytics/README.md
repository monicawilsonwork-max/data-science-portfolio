# SQL Analytics

**Goal:** Answer concrete business questions using SQL over a small SQLite database.

## Setup
- Place CSVs in `data/raw/`; use `scripts/load_to_sqlite.py` to create `data/processed/warehouse.db`

## Questions (examples)
1. Which customer segments have the highest 30‑day retention?
2. What are the weekly revenue trends and seasonality?
3. Which products drive the top 20% of revenue (Pareto)?

## Acceptance Criteria
- SQL queries saved in `sql/` with comments
- A short `reports/answers.md` summarizing results with 2–3 charts
